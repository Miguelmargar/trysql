  Use 1 insert statement to insert multiple tracks at the same time.
  Use Google to find the correct syntax for the Insert statement to do this.

-- NOTE: Use the create_table.sql Script to create the table and Data for this Lesson


/*
  You can delete rows from a table using the 'DELETE' SQL Statement.
  The syntax is similar to the basic 'SELECT' statement, with a 'WHERE' Clause.
  However, instead of returning the matching rows, the 'DELETE' statement, deletes them.
*/


-- Just as a SELECT statement without a WHERE clause will return all rows,
-- A DELETE statement without a WHERE clause will delete all rows.
delete from Note;

-- Delete a Note with a specific NoteId
delete from Note where NoteId = 3;

-- Delete all Notes for a Specific Track, by Specific Customer
delete from Note where TrackId = 3504 and CustomerId = 2;

-- Delete any Notes that mention Bono
-- Note the wildcard '%' will match any text. So 'Bono' can appear anywhere in the text'
delete from Note where TEXT Like "%Bono%";


/*
  Since the SELECT and DELETE Statements share the same WHERE clause,
  it's good practice, when deleting rows, to write a SELECT statement
  that returns the rows to be deleted, and then convert that into a DELETE statement.
 */

-- Write a query that returns all tracks for the Album "Boy" (AlbumId = 348)
select  * from Track where AlbumId = 348;

-- Convert SELECT Statement to a DELETE Statement
delete from Track where AlbumId = 348;

 */

/*
  Previously, when you wanted to delete Tracks for a given Album, you needed to query the Album Table
  to get the AlbumId, and then use that Id in the DELETE From Track statement.

  You can Delete Tracks by Album Title, by using a Subquery. Google Deleting using a SubQuery and try to
  write a Delete Statement that will delete all Tracks for the Album "Boy"

Peg Column
select 'America' as Continent, Customer.* from Customer where Country = 'USA' or Country = 'Canada'
union
select 'Europe' as Continent, Customer.* from Customer where Country = 'United Kingdom' or Country = 'Spain' or Country = 'Germany';
this creates a brand new column called continent and allocates America to usa and cananda and allocates europe to uk, spain and germany
